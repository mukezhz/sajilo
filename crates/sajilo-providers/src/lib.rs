//! Upstream fetchers and parsers for every public source Sajilo reads.
//!
//! Fetching and parsing are deliberately separate: each provider exposes a
//! `parse` that takes the raw bytes it was given, so every parser test runs
//! against a recorded fixture and no test in this crate touches the network.
//! Live checks live in `.github/workflows/smoke.yml` and run on a schedule.
